This is verry basic ASP.Net Web Application for buying drinks online.
The initial db is seeded. 
The app has two types of accounts. Users and Admin.
The ordinary users can only watch, buy and checkout. 
Admin Users  can Create Update and Delete Drinks except ordinary premisions.

The Admin Credentials are 
Username = admin@admin.com
Password = 123qwe

Ordinary users are not seeded since you can use the Register.
